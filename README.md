# R : Pokemon case-study

## About

This is a case study on Pokemon using the R programming language, where we have worked on the 'Pokemon' dataset and learned to capture "fire-type", "water-type", and "grass-type" Pokemon.
It also shows what makes a Pokemon legendary through some data analysis.
The Pokemon dataset has 721 Pokemons along with attributes of them such as speed, attack, defense, generation, etc.
